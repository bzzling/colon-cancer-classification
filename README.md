# Colon Cancer Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project aims to classify images in the given dataset as colon adenocarcinoma or benign colon tissue, making use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the PyTorch library.

### Report:

Refer to the [report] (report.pdf) and [code](./Code) for further details and in-depth analysis.

### Results:
- Results after training 1000 images of colon adenocarcinoma and benign colon tissue
    - number of epochs = ~
    - training data / validation data split = 80/20
    - MODEL
        - ~
